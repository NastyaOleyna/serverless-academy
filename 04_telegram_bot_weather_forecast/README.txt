This is a Telegram Bot Weather Forecast.
To start this app use "npm start".

Telegram Bot has few commands: 
/start - to start bot

/help - to see more about bot

/stop - to stop sending a weather forecast 
(I usually use this command when I test this bot and make intervals between messages less than one minute
 to see how this bot works. So if you will make intervals less than 3 or 6 hours this command will help you to stop
 getting a lot of messages without stopping bot.)

 /changeinterval - to change interval between messages from bot

 /changeunit - to change unit. You can choose metric or imperial.
