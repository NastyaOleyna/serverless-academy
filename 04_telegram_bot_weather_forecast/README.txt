This is a Telegram Bot Weather Forecast.
To start this app use "npm start".

In this Telegram Bot you can see what the weather is like now 
or get the weather for the next 5 days in intervals of 3 or 6 hours.
Also you can get info about weather every 3 or 6 hours.

Telegram Bot has few commands: 
/start - to start bot

/help - to see more about bot

/stop - to stop sending a weather forecast 
(I usually use this command when I test this bot and make intervals between messages less than one minute
 to see how this bot works. So if you will make intervals less than 3 or 6 hours this command will help you to stop
 getting a lot of messages without stopping bot.)

 /changeinterval - to change interval between messages from bot

 /changeunit - to change unit. You can choose metric or imperial. 

 /weathernow - to see what is the weather right now.
